		<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
		<p>I'm Thomas! I was born on March 4, 2008, and spent my early childhood in Seattle. I began attending Annie Wright in sixth grade, and I now live in Tacoma with my mom and dad, as well as two cats.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
		<p>
			I have multiple interests and hobbies, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Linguistics, mainly phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax.</li>
				<li>Computer science, especially fields such as computer graphics, instruction set architecture, and theoretical digital logic and circuitry.</li>
				<li>Mathematics, especially linear algebra (in part due to its many applications in computer science).</li>
			</ul>
			I also enjoy playing video games of all sorts, and programming small projects for fun.
			<br>
			<br>
			Below is a video of a monolingual fieldwork demonstrationâ€”an exercise in which a linguist attempts to gain some insight on a language's structure without having any languages in common with the speaker.

		<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>
		<p>
			I have had several achievements throughout my life:
			<ul>
				<li>I beat my cousin at chess who is really good at chess, after which I beat the same cousin at 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel (a very fun chess variant played on the computer).</li>
				<li>I pulled off a parry number two followed by a flawless second intention with indirect riposte on my friend who is way better than me at fencing (second intention is a maneuver in which instead of following through, the initial attack is intentionally short, allowing for a rapid retreat with a parry followed by a riposte).</li>
				<li>Me and a friend won a game of sailing tag once (a game played in sailboats where tennis balls are thrown into other boats in order to tag).</li>
				<li>I won a kahoot in history class in eighth grade.</li>
			</ul>
			Below is an image of 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel gameplay.
