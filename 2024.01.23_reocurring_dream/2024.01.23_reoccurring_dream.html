			I have a very simple reoccurring dream. I find myself, either sitting or standing, in an office-like room with light tan walls, carpet flooring, and a tile ceiling. The room is a perfect cube, with each wall measuring 16 feet by 16 feet according to measurements I took in the dream once. There are no windows or doors, and the room is devoid of decoration. Occasionally however, when exploring the room, I come across a door in the middle of the back wall which was not there before. If I choose to open it, I awake immediately. Otherwise, I remain in the room until either the dream ends on its own or I am woken up.
